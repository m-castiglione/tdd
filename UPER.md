<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* From what I gathered, the problem is that there are 3 inputs of various items and they have a corresponding amount of outputs.
The items have prices associated with them and a sales tax and an import tax is associated with these items. If the item is a book, food, or medical, then tax is voided.
If the item is an import, a 5% tax is added. Additionally if the item is not a book, food, or medicine, then a 10% tax is added.
This should be a simple console program that measures my skills as a coder that incorporates OOP/OOD dynamics and techniques.
I also need to use a testing framework to produce unit testings.
